## Project Description

Fishky is more than just a flashcard app; it's your personal learning assistant, designed to
make studying efficient, effective, and enjoyable. Fishky uses a spaced repetition algorithm to help you
memorize information quickly and retain it for the long term. With Fishky, you can create your own
flashcards, or choose from a variety of pre-made decks.



## How to use


Fishky is designed to streamline the creation of flashcards using text extracted from images or directly input by the user. Follow these steps to make the most of the application:

#### 1. Upload an Image (Optional)

Start by uploading an image using the "IMAGE" button. This step is optional but highly useful if you have visual materials like handwritten notes, book photos, or screenshots.
Fishky will automatically extract text from the uploaded image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithms, making the content editable and ready for flashcard creation.

#### 2. Input or Edit Text

If you skipped the image upload or after extracting the text, you can input new text or edit the extracted content in the text input section.
Format the text and divide it into smaller sections using a semicolon (;). This will help the application process the text efficiently in the next steps.

#### 3. Generate Phrases

Click the "GET PHRASES FROM TEXT" button to automatically split your text into smaller, manageable phrases that will form the basis of your flashcards.
You can edit, modify, or remove any generated phrases to tailor them to your specific learning needs.


#### 4. Edit Phrases

Review the generated phrases. Each phrase will appear in a separate field where you can edit, remove, or add new phrases.
Use the trash icon next to each phrase to delete any unwanted content.

#### 5. Translate Phrases

Click "TRANSLATE PHRASES" to automatically translate your phrases into the desired language.
Both the original phrases and their translations can be edited to ensure they fit your context and language nuances.

#### 6. Save or Export Flashcards

Once you are satisfied with your flashcards, give your set a name and choose what to do next:
Save to Fishky: The set will be saved in the app's database under the “learn” section, allowing you to access and use the flashcards directly in Fishky.
Copy to Clipboard: Export the flashcards to use them in external applications like Quizlet, providing flexibility to continue your learning process in your preferred environment.
